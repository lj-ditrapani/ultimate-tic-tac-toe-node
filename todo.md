Bugs:
- sometimes active cell/board is wrong when switching turns
- clear active boards/cells when your turn is over?
- status update/drawGame should clear selected board...

Refactor drawBackground
- let drawGame do some of the work
- drawBackground doesn't call draw

- Publish to Docker hub
- add github action to build image
